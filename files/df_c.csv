sesión del pleno del congreso del 27102016 votaron por la elección inconstitucional ilegal antirreglamentaria fraude procesal 1 josé chlimper ackerman 2 rafael rey rey y 3 elmer rafael cuba bustinza como miembros del directorio del banco central reserva según aparece en la resolución legislativa del congreso n 00820162017cr del 27102016 publicada en el peruano al día siguiente cuya nulidad debe ser declarada porque se dictó en violación los artículos 86 94 y 102 inciso 2 la constitución política del artículo 11 la ley orgánica del banco central reserva del perú y del artículo 64 1ª parte e inciso c del reglamento del congresoextraña proponente fraude procesal prima facie la aludida elección fue hecha ante pedido claro dolo fraude procesal misterioso nada transparente sospechoso y asaz temerario planteado por la ciudadana keiko sofía fujimori higuchi quien es una persona particular lideresa máxima del partido político fuerza popular y ejerce función alguna en el congreso que ella propuso chlimper y cuba lo confesó el congresista fujimorista miguel ángel torres morales al declarar sin ambages al periódico perú 21 el 2 noviembre del año en curso keiko pidió ayer y tuvo efecto al día siguiente por una suerte arte congresal birlibirloque manumitido porque así opera eficacia y velocidad el fraude procesal art 416 código penal que ella sigilosamente puso en marchano dijo torres morales si tal proposición keiko fujimori fue oralmente por escrito por fax o tuit ni ante qué autoridad u órgano del congreso lo hizo aunque se sabe que fue puesta en conocimiento la junta portavoces del congreso que preside luz salgado recién ese mismo día 2112016 las 4 la tarde y la meteórica y espasmódica elección fue al día siguiente 3112016 en horas la mañana en menos 24 horas sin debate alguno en el pleno sin que los congresistas votantes tengan entre manos el currículum vitae o siquiera algunos documentos que permitieran apreciar o escudriñar sobre si los candidatos propuestos tenían o los requisitos que la ley orgánica del banco central reserva exige como son reconocida solvencia moral y una amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas y que representen entidad o interés particular alguno obviamente estos requisitos deben acreditarse documentos deducirse y inferirse del aire por tratarse hechos macizos sostenidos en el tiempo tampoco supeditarse el voto consignas partidarias amén la subida trascendencia del elegidopetitorioque en estricta aplicación del artículo 40 del código procesal constitucional que permite interponer demanda amparo cualquier persona por violaciones los derechos difusos que gocen reconocimiento constitucional como al aire al agua al medio ambiente al patrimonio cultural e histórico al legítimo ejercicio la función pública la institucionalidad cabal asidero constitucional legal y reglamentario si acaso alguien los ha logrado contaminar o averiar interpongo esta demanda amparo por la afectación o lesión que agravia al estado o la sociedad en general los siguientes derechos constitucionales1 contar funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamente 2 al voto congresal válido apego constitución política ley orgánica del banco central reserva y al reglamento del congreso y 3 la transparencia los actos del estado que garantice el acceso la información públicaen consecuencia solicito que reponiéndose las cosas al estado anterior la violación los derechos denunciada se declare la nulidad dejar sin efecto la resolución legislativa n 00820162017cr 27102016 publicada en el peruano el 28102016 y del procedimiento especial parlamentario que le sirve antecedente la misma fecha donde se omitió adrede el debate y se adoptó acuerdos vía votación ilegítima sin previo debate que el reglamento del congreso exige artículo 64 pasos procedimentales que son obligatorio cumplimiento por estar previstos en normas especiales atinentes precisamente la elección los miembros del directorio del banco central reserva que le compete al congreso tal como lo prevé el artículo 86 nuestra carta políticafundamentos hecho y jurídicos1 derecho contar funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamenteel artículo 86 la constitución política se ocupa expresamente la elección por el congreso tres 3 miembros del directorio del banco central reserva por lo tanto los ciudadanos tenemos el derecho que esta selección o elección sea minuciosa ponderada responsable y legítima contando los elementos juicio del caso se elige ciegas por consignas inalámbricas sin verle la cara al elegido sin escucharlo y sin examinar quién es como en realidad se hizo se violó pues suma torpeza esta norma constitucionalcomo quiera que la propia constitución política consigna otros ingredientes tal elección ella misma se remite que sea el reglamento del congreso el que la desarrolle eso se ocupa el artículo 94 la misma carta política cuando establece el congreso elabora y aprueba su reglamento que tiene fuerza ley este reglamento el congreso opera actúa o funciona y discreción la presidenta o pero aún una persona particular como keiko fujimoricon tal sentido y propósito el aludido y vigente reglamento del congreso trata expresamente la elección esos tres directores en llamado procedimiento parlamentario especial el mismo que ha sido burlado transgredido o violado pese su asidero constitucional y su indiscutido rango legal veamos lo que establece su artículo 64 inciso c del procedimiento especial como uno los 3 procedimientos parlamentarioslos procedimientos parlamentarios son el conjunto actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate y los acuerdos del congreso destinados producir leyes y resoluciones legislativas actos control político y designaciones y nombramientos pueden sera procedimiento legislativo que comprende el debate y aprobación leyes ordinarias leyes orgánicas leyes autoritativas para ejercer la legislación delegada leyes presupuestales y financieras leyes demarcación territorial leyes reforma la constitución política del reglamento del congreso y resoluciones legislativas b procedimientos del control político que comprende la investidura del consejo ministros la interpelación los ministros la invitación los ministros para que informen las preguntas los ministros la solicitud información los ministros y la administración en general la censura y la extensión confianza los ministros la investigación sobre cualquier asunto interés público la dación cuenta y el antejuicio políticoc procedimientos especiales que comprende la designación del contralor la elección del defensor del pueblo los miembros del tribunal constitucional y 3 miembros del directorio del banco central reserva así como la ratificación del presidente dicho banco y del superintendente banca y seguros artículo modificado aprobado por el pleno del congreso fecha 6 marzo 1998en consecuencia el procedimiento especial donde resultaron elegidos los 03 directores en cuestión vulneró o violó lo que dispone la parte general e introductoria este artículo 64 del reglamento del congreso aplicable aquél respecto todo procedimiento parlamentario que es definido como el conjunto actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate y los acuerdos del congreso destinados producirresoluciones legislativas actos control político y designaciones y nombramientoslo real y apodíctico fue que en aquella sesión donde se produjo la elección hubo debate alguno por lo que se examinó nada que permita colegir que se eligieron o escogieron quienes tenían una reconocida solvencia moral o quizá amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas todo fue remedocomo se podrá fácilmente advertir la elección del jueves 27102016 se hizo en procedimiento especial reglamentario sino en uno trucado sin promover el debate y además sin adoptar los acuerdos como producto dicho debatepor lo tanto solo se transgredió el artículo 86 la constitución política sino también la primera parte y además el inciso c del artículo 64 del reglamento del congreso expreso fundamento constitucional lo cual la ciudadanía peruana toda la que formo parte resultó agraviada en su derecho contar funcionarios del banco central reserva constitucional legal y reglamentariamente elegidospor ende los 3 ciudadanos que este modo vedado resultaron electos josé chlimper ackerman rafael rey rey y elmer rafael cuba bustinza frente una proposición keiko fujimori fraude procesal son ilegítimos2 derecho al voto congresal válido apego constitución política ley orgánica del banco central reserva y reglamento del congresocomo se sabe la elección los 3 miembros del directorio del banco central reserva fue por 84 votos la elmer cuba por 72 la josé chlimper y por 71 la rafael rey ningún guarismo esa votación puede considerarse válido legítimo porque ninguno los votantes tenía la información documental que oficialmente se debería haber presentado distribuido cada uno los parlamentarios y examinada como fundamento su voto la propia misteriosa proposición dos candidaturas por keiko fujimori sabemos que apareja ningún documento los candidatos pese que la ley orgánica del banco central reserva en su artículo 11 exige como requisitos los que aspiren ser miembros del directorio del banco tener reconocida solvencia moral y una amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas se trata elementos reales hechos que deben probarse documentos indubitables que el votante tiene que tener ante sí para analizar contrastar evaluar y decidir su voto apego derecho sin falsear su decisión través del voto informado o por intereses vitandos que agreden al país reza el violado y desacatado al votar inválidamente artículo 11 la citada ley orgánica los directores deben ser peruanos tener reconocida solvencia moral y poseer amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas representan entidad o interés particular alguno y su voto debe tener en cuenta únicamente el cumplimiento la finalidad y las funciones del banco si todos los congresistas votantes nunca vieron dentro del llevado cabo procedimiento especial parlamentario al que hemos antes glosado ningún documento los 3 propuestos 2 por keiko y otro dizque por el apra ni hubo debate alguno el cual se obvió adrede respecto sus calidades personales y profesionales el voto que emitieron fue ciego inducido por el mentado fraude sin deliberación mental alguna al carecer elementos juicio objetivos reales sobre esa reconocida solvencia moral la necesaria amplia competencia y además la amplia experiencia que deben favorecer cada uno los propuestos para voto aprobatorio válidamente emitido si los hechosrequisitos y su prueba concomitante están ante sí del congresista votante su voto resulta viciado por ende ilegítimo y nulo3 derecho la transparencia los actos del estado que garantice el acceso la información públicatodo indica que nada en este procedimiento parlamentario elección estos 3 directores del bcrp fue transparente todo fue turbio principio fin clarísimo fraude procesal iniciado por la demandada keiko fujimori tanto la repentina proposición fraudulenta hecha por keiko fujimori el día 26102016 día antes la elección sin que se sepa hasta hoy cómo fue ante una junta portavoces que recibió ni vio los currículum vitae los propuestos así como la aluvional votación llevada cabo el día siguiente el jueves 27102016 sin examinar ningún documento acerca los requisitos que la ley exige los candidatos y sin el debate que el artículo 64 del reglamento del congreso requiere para esta elección específica en procedimiento parlamentario especial en relación las calidades personales y profesionales los 3 futuros miembros del directorio del banco central reserva reviste la obligatoria transparencia que deben adornar los actos del estado como éste del congreso que prevé y regula la ley 27806 o ley transparencia fin garantizar el derecho fundamental del acceso la información que consagra el numeral 5 del artículo 2 la constitución políticacuando los actos estatales realizados en todo el procedimiento especializado parlamentario en cuestión son transparentes como en efecto lo han sido el derecho fundamental la información pública resulta vulnerado lo cual debe ser reparadofue la bravura una bravísima keiko su audacia o interés nefando que la llevó proponer fraude miembros del bcrp por lo menos se sabe que fue keiko fujimori quien propuso oralmente o por escrito su secretario general su partido político josé chlimper y su ocasional asesor elmer cuba como directores del bcrp ambos activistas su campaña electoral presidencial última y ninguno los 72 congresistas suyos chistó rechistó ni hizo amago mueca alguna todos doblegaron la cerviz y designaron día otro mediante su voto los propuestos sin trámite ni debate alguno ciegamente sin examen requisitos legales y sin tener la vista semejantes candidatos ni siquiera oírlos porque tenían una premura inusitadatiene una persona particular como keiko fujimori lideresa una agrupación partidaria el derecho proponer efectos legales e inmediatos en procedimiento especial parlamentario sin ser congresista directores del citado banco nada menos que al secretario general su partido fuerza popular y otro activista su reciente campaña electoral presidencialserán los propuestos contundente actuación político partidaria las personas independientes que contribuyan la autonomía que requiere el bcrp sin poner en riesgo la confidencialidad una sana política bancaria y monetaria en particularlo confiesa alegremente que ella fue la que propuso estos 2 candidatos su atento y comedido lugarteniente congresista miguel torres morales hijo antiguo fujimorista ultramontano carlos torres y torres lara ya fallecido pero que dejó su heredero universal en el congreso y precisamente al lado o detrás keiko su padre estuvo detrás alberto hoy presosi esta proposición fraudulenta silenciosa y nada transparente fue suficiente para que 72 votaran por ella significa que keiko fujimori maneja su antojo los 72 congresistas su partido fuerza popular ora directamente o por interpósita persona como lo hacía antes vladimiro montesinos torres hoy también preso en los años 90además la proposición y decisión adoptada viola el texto expreso del artículo 11 la ley orgánica del banco central reserva del perúinconstitucional ilegalidad delito y producto ilegítimola conducta es la pluralidad actos realizados que exteriorizan una voluntad y el producto es el resultado conseguido esa conductalos congresistas mayormente fujimoristas que designaron josé chlimper rafael rey y elmer cuba para integrar el directorio del banco central reserva del perú bcrp violaron la constitución política las leyes orgánica dicho banco transparencia y el reglamento del congreso la república en la forma antes anotadacuando tales parlamentarios producen actos administrativos como es designar miembros del directorio del bcrp o integrantes otros organismos están obligados respetar las normas constitucionales y las legales todo tipo y zurrarse en ellas sin incurrir en responsabilidad su designio es respetar las normas preexistentesla ley orgánica del banco central reserva del perú en su artículo 11 obliga que se designe como miembros del directorio del banco quienes tienen reconocida solvencia moral y además amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas requisitos que son hechos macizos que deben ser reales y acreditados los documentos respectivos el congresista que vota por alguien propuesto puede crear estos hechos en su cabeza deducirlos meros dichos o inferirlos por consigna partidaria viola la ley si desoye este mandato legal comete pues una ilegalidad una arbitrariedaddel mismo modo todo parlamentario debe velar por el respeto la constitución y las leyes porque así lo establece el artículo 102 inciso 2 la constitución política hasta podríamos aseverar que deben dar el ejemplo en acatar la constitución y lo que dispone toda norma legal este precepto constitucional fue desacatado por todos aquellos congresistas que designaron su voto chlimper rey y cuba como miembros del bcrp sin que estén acreditadas las situaciones hecho que la citada ley orgánica ha previsto violaron por ende esa norma constitucional que les obliga respetar las leyes en general y la del bcrp en

517,russia cina e arabia saudita domano legemonia del dollaro di ariel noyola rodríguez gli stati uniti aumentano gli ostacoli tentando di mantenere legemonia del dollaro come valuta di riserva mondiale negli ultimi mesi paesi emergenti hanno venduto molti buoni del tesoro degli usa principalmente russia e cina ma anche arabia saudita inoltre proteggersi dalle violente fluttuazioni del dollaro le banche centrali di diversi paesi acquistano enormi quantità di oro diversificare le riserve valutarie breve loffensiva globale nei confronti del dollaro è esplosa attraverso la vendita massiccia di debito degli stati uniti e parallelo lacquisto colossale di metalli preziosi rete voltaire città del messico messico 5 novembre 2016 français español la supremazia di washington nel sistema finanziario globale ha subito colpo tremendo ad agosto russia cina e arabia saudita vendevamo titoli del tesoro degli stati uniti 379 miliardi di dollari secondo lultimo aggiornamento dei dati ufficiali pubblicato da pochi giorni 1 dal punto di vista generale gli investimenti globali nel debito pubblico degli stati uniti sono al livello minimo dal luglio 2012 chiaramente il ruolo del dollaro valuta di riserva mondiale è ancora messo discussione nel 2010 lammiraglio michael mullen presidente del joint chiefs staff statunitense avvertì che il debito era la principale minaccia alla sicurezza nazionale 2 mio avviso non è tanto lalto debito pubblico oltre 19 000 miliardi 3 ad ostacolare leconomia degli stati uniti ma washington è di fondamentale importanza garantirsi enorme flusso di risorse estere ogni giorno coprire deficit gemelli commercio e bilancio cioè il dipartimento del tesoro è questione di vita o di morte vendere titoli di debito nel mondo e così finanziare le spese degli usa si ricordi che dal fallimento di lehman brothers nel settembre 2008 bank china ha subito forti pressioni da ben bernanke allora presidente della federal reserve fed non vendere titoli del debito degli stati uniti primo momento cinesi decisero di mantenere il dollaro tuttavia da allora volte la pboc evitava di acquistare altri titoli degli stati uniti e allo stesso tempo avviava piano diversificare le riserve valutarie pechino acquista oro maniera massiccia negli ultimi anni e lo stesso fa la banca centrale della russia nel secondo trimestre del 2016 le riserve auree della banca di cina hanno raggiunto le 1 823 tonnellate contro le 1 762 tonnellate registrate nellultimo trimestre del 2015 la federazione russa ha aumentato le riserve auree di circa 290 tonnellate tra dicembre 2014 e giugno 2016 chiudendo il secondo trimestre di questanno totale di 1 500 tonnellate di fronte ai brutali scossoni del dollaro è fondamentale acquistare asset più sicuri come loro che tempi di grave instabilità finanziaria agisce da rifugio sicuro quindi la strategia di mosca e pechino nel vendere titoli del tesoro degli usa e comprare oro viene seguita da molti paesi come stimato dal fondo monetario internazionale fmi le riserve auree delle banche centrali nel mondo hanno già raggiunto il massimo degli ultimi 15 anni registrando ai primi di ottobre volume di circa 33 000 tonnellate 4 la geopolitica fa la sua parte nel plasmare il nuovo ordine finanziario mondiale dopo limposizione delle sanzioni economiche al cremlino partire dal 2014 il rapporto la cina ha avuto grande rilevanza russi da allora le potenze hanno approfondito legami tutti settori dalleconomia e finanza alla cooperazione militare inoltre assicurando la fornitura di gas alla cina prossimi tre decenni il presidente vladimir putin ha costruito lomologo xi jinping una potente alleanza finanziaria che cerca di porre fine una volta tutte al dominio della moneta statunitense attualmente gli idrocarburi che mosca vende pechino sono pagati yuan non dollari così la moneta del popolo renminbi cinese emerge gradualmente nel mercato mondiale degli idrocarburi il commercio tra russia e cina paesi che mio parere guidano la costruzione del sistema monetario multipolare la grande novità è che alla corsa la dedollarizzazione delleconomia globale si è unita larabia saudita paese decenni fedele alleato della politica estera di washington sorprendentemente negli ultimi 12 mesi riad sè sbarazzata di più di 19 miliardi di dollari investiti titoli del tesoro degli stati uniti divenendo insieme alla cina uno dei principali venditori di debito degli stati uniti 5 peggiorare le cose il regno saudita si accanisce sempre più la casa bianca fine settembre il congresso degli stati uniti approvava leliminazione del veto del presidente barack obama ad una legge che impediva negli usa di denunciare larabia saudita tribunale il presunto coinvolgimento negli attentati dell11 settembre 2001 6 insieme lorganizzazione dei paesi esportatori del petrolio opec ha raggiunto accordo storico la russia ridurre la produzione di petrolio e quindi promuovere laumento dei prezzi 7 e anche sorprendente che giusto oggi pechino abbia aperto allo scambio diretto tra yuan e riyal saudita attraverso il trading foreign exchange della cina cfets nellacronimo inglese le transazioni tra le valute senza passare dal dollaro di conseguenza è molto probabile che più prima che poi la compagnia petrolifera saudi aramco accetti pagamenti yuan invece che dollari 8 se si accadesse la casa dei saud punterebbe tutto sul petroyuan 9 il mondo cambia davanti ai nostri occhi,1

диктуют необходимость наращивания сотрудничества между организацией объединенных наций и региональными и субрегиональными организациями в области поддержания мира и безопасностиприменительно к организации объединенных наций это прежде всего ее универсальный характер как с точки зрения членства в организации так и ее деятельности а также всемирно признанная легитимность региональные организации в свою очередь зачастую обладают более тонким пониманием ситуации в зоне своей ответственности а в целом ряде случаев адаптированными к местным реалиям превентивными и миротворческими механизмами при этом важно чтобы деятельность региональных организаций была направлена на поиск мирного политического решения возникающих конфликтных ситуацийименно в этом контексте высокую актуальность имеют регулярные сверки часов с основными региональными партнерами организации объединенных наций в вопросах поддержания международного мира и безопасности так совет безопасности на плановой основе проводит заседания по сотрудничеству с африканским союзом организацией по безопасности и сотрудничеству в европе европейским союзом в последние годы проводился обзор взаимодействия с

les étatsunis se sont dotés pour dominer lensemble du monde cet article est dautant plus important que cest cette domination clairement assumée cette organisation unipolaire du monde que la syrie la russie et la chine mettent aujourdhui en cause les armes à la mainréseau voltaire rome italie 27 octobre 2016 je vais tout suite au nœud la question je pense quon ne peut pas parler relations entre union européenne et chine indépendamment linfluence que les étatsunis exercent sur lunion européenne directement et par lintermédiaire lotanaujourdhui 22 des 28 pays lue 21 sur 27 après la sortie du royaumeuni lue avec plus 90 la population lunion font partie lotan reconnue par lue comme fondement la défense collective et lotan est sous commandement le commandant suprême allié en europe est toujours nommé par le président des étatsunis damérique et tous les autres commandements clé sont aux mains des usa la politique étrangère et militaire lunion européenne est ainsi fondamentalement subordonnée à la stratégie étatsunienne sur laquelle convergent les plus grandes puissances européennescette stratégie clairement énoncée dans les documents officiels est tracée au moment historique où la situation mondiale change à la suite la désagrégation lurss en 1991 la maisonblanche déclare dans la national security strategy united states les étatsunis demeurent le seul état avec une force une portée et une influence en toute dimension politique économique et militaire réellement globales il nexiste aucun substitut au leadership américain en 1992 dans la defense planning guidance le pentagone souligne notre premier objectif est dempêcher quune quelconque puissance domine une région dont les ressources seraient suffisantes pour engendrer une puissance mondiale ces régions comprennent leurope occidentale lasie orientale le territoire lexunion soviétique et lasie sudoccidentale en 2001 dans le rapport quadrennial defense review publié une semaine avant la guerre usaotan en afghanistan aire première importance géostratégique à légard russie et chine le pentagone annonce la possibilité existe quémerge dans la région rival militaire avec une formidable base ressources nos forces armées doivent conserver la capacité dimposer la volonté des étatsunis à nimporte quel adversaire y compris états et entités nonétatiques façon à changer le régime dun état adverse ou occuper territoire étranger jusquà ce que les objectifs stratégiques étatsuniens soient réalisés sur la base cette stratégie lotan sous commandement lancé son offensive sur le oriental après avoir démoli par la guerre la fédération yougoslave 1999 à aujourdhui elle englobé tous les états lexpacte varsovie trois lexyougoslavie trois lexurss et sous peu elle en englobera dautres à commencer par la géorgie et lukraine cette dernière étant fait déjà dans lotan en déplaçant bases et forces y compris nucléaires toujours plus près la russie en même temps sur le méridional étroitement relié à celui oriental lotan sous commandement démoli par la guerre létat libyen et essayé den faire autant avec celui la syrieles usa et lotan ont fait exploser la crise ukrainienne et accusant la russie déstabiliser la sécurité européenne ils ont entraîné leurope dans une nouvelle guerre froide voulue surtout par washington aux dépens des économies européennes à qui les sanctions et contresanctions ont porté préjudice pour casser les rapports économiques et politiques russieue néfastes aux intérêts étatsuniens cest dans la même stratégie quentre le déplacement croissant forces militaires étatsuniennes dans la région asiepacifique dans une fonction antichinoise lus navy annoncé quen 2020 elle concentrera dans cette région 60 ses forces navales et aériennesla stratégie étatsunienne est focalisée sur la mer chine méridionale dont lamiral harris chef du commandement pour le pacifique souligne limportance cest là que passe commerce maritime dune valeur annuelle plus 5 000 milliards dollars dont 25 lexport mondial pétrole et 50 celui du gaz naturel les usa veulent contrôler cette voie maritime au nom celle que lamiral harris définit comme une liberté naviguer fondamentale pour notre système vie ici aux étatsunis en accusant la chine d actions agressives en mer chinoise méridionale analogues à celles la russie en crimée pour cela lus navy patrouille la mer chine méridionale dans le sillage des étatsunis arrivent les plus grandes puissances européennes en juillet dernier la france sollicité lunion européenne pour coordonner la patrouille navale la mer chinoise méridionale afin dassurer une présence régulière et visible dans ces eaux illégalement réclamées par la chine et tandis que les étatsunis installent en corée du sud des systèmes antimissiles mais en mesure lancer aussi des missiles nucléaires analogues à ceux installés contre la russie en roumanie et bientôt en pologne en plus ceux qui sont embarqués sur des navires guerre en méditerranée le secrétaire général lotan jens stoltenberg reçoit le 6 octobre à bruxelles le ministre des affaires étrangères sudcoréen yun byungse pour renforcer le partenariat lotan avec séoul ces faits et dautres encore démontrent quen europe et en asie la même stratégie est à lœuvre cest la tentative extrême des étatsunis et des autres puissances occidentales maintenir la suprématie économique politique et militaire dans monde en forte transformation dans lequel émergent nouveaux sujets étatiques et sociaux lorganisation coopération shanghai née laccord stratégique sinorusse dispose ressources et capacités travail capables den faire la plus grande aire économique intégrée du monde lorganisation shanghai et les brics sont en mesure avec leurs organismes financiers supplanter en grande partie la banque mondiale et le fonds monétaire international qui pendant plus 70 ans ont permis aux usa et aux plus grandes puissances occidentales dominer léconomie mondiale à travers les prêts usuraires aux pays endettés et dautres instruments financiers les nouveaux organismes peuvent en même temps réaliser la dédollarisation des échanges commerciaux en ôtant aux étatsunis la capacité décharger leur dette sur dautres pays par limpression papier monnaie utilisé comme devise internationale dominantepour maintenir leur suprématie toujours plus vacillante les étatsunis utilisent non seulement la force des armes mais dautres armes souvent plus efficaces que celles proprement dites première arme les dits accords libreéchange comme le partenariat transatlantique sur le commerce et les investissements ttip avec lue et le partenariat transpacifique tpp dont le nest pas seulement économique mais géopolitique et géostratégique cest pour cela quhillary clinton qualifie le partenariat usaue plus grand objectif stratégique notre alliance transatlantique en projetant une otan économique qui intègre celle politique et militaire le projet est clair bloc politique économique et militaire usaue toujours sous commandement étatsunien qui soppose à laire eurasiatique en ascension basée sur la coopération entre la chine et la russie qui soppose aux brics à liran et à tout autre pays qui se soustraie à la domination loccident comme les négociations sur le ttip ont du mal à avancer à cause divergences dintérêt et dune vaste opposition en europe lobstacle est pour le moment contourné avec l accord
